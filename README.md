Certainly! Here's a simple README.md file for your HTTP web server:

# Simple C HTTP Web Server

This is a basic HTTP web server implemented in C. It serves static HTML content to clients over the local network and dynamically determines the IP address associated with a specified network interface.

## Features

- Serves static HTML content over HTTP.
- Dynamically determines the IP address associated with a specified network interface.
- Supports basic error handling for file opening, socket creation, binding, listening, and sending responses.

## Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C libraries
- POSIX-compatible operating system

## Usage

1. Ensure that the `index.html` file exists in the same directory as the server executable.

2. Compile the source code using a C compiler.

    ```bash
    gcc http_server.c -o http_server
    ```

3. Run the server executable.

    ```bash
    ./http_server
    ```

4. The server will automatically determine the IP address associated with a specified network interface (e.g., `"eth0"`, `"wlan0"`). It will bind to this IP address and start listening for incoming connections on port `8080`.

5. Access the server from a web browser or client application using the IP address and port number. For example:

    ```
    http://<server_ip>:8080
    ```

## Configuration

- **Network Interface**: Modify the `interface_name` variable in the source code (`http_server.c`) to specify the network interface whose IP address the server should use.

    ```c
    char *interface_name = "eth0"; // Change this to the name of your network interface
    ```

## Limitations

- This server is a simple example and lacks advanced features such as support for dynamic content generation, HTTPS encryption, and concurrent connections handling.
